# Maze Puzzle Solver

This is a web-based puzzle solver that uses a backtracking algorithm to find a path through a user-defined grid that satisfies constraints on the number of cells visited in each row and column.

## Features

- **Dynamic Grid Creation**: Set the grid size (number of rows and columns) according to your requirements.
- **Editable Constraints**: Specify the number of cells to visit for each row and column through input fields.
- **Solution Visualization**: Displays the solution path directly on the grid if a valid solution is found.
- **Backtracking Algorithm**: Uses a recursive backtracking approach to explore possible paths through the grid.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/king7d/maze-solver.git
   cd maze-puzzle-solver
